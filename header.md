# The World's Truly Slowest HELLO WORLD Program

Crafted with love, humor, and a touch of stubbornness by an old-school programmer approaching 80 (in collaboration with ChatGPT, the whippersnapper AI).

This is not your typical "HELLO WORLD" project. No shortcuts, no rush. One dot at a time, one commit at a time, this masterpiece emerges at a speed only true patience can appreciate. If you think you've seen slow programming before, think again.
